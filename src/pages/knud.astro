    You take a step towards another chapter today, a new dawn awaits.<br />
    Two paths as one, two hearts in harmony.<br />
    The sunlight is fresh, the world feels gentle,<br />
    And you have my undivided happiness.<br /><br />

    I've seen you grow through light and storm, through quiet aspirations and fearless heights,<br />
    and now you stand with such genuine love, a wider view and a fuller sky.<br /><br />

    May you spread kindness and laughter throughout the years to come,<br />
    just like you always used to.<br />
    May you experience grace each morning and may there be peace everywhere,<br />
    just like how you made each one of my days feel like.<br /><br />

    And know that I'm here, your forever friend, as your chapters merge.<br />
    Supporting the love you've discovered,<br />
    A secure, unbroken bond.<br /><br />

    So let's celebrate happiness, the beautiful art of love,<br />
    and living life with an open heart.<br />
    And since your adventure is just getting started,<br />
    Make it your best journey, Little Sunshine.<br /><br />

    <strong>Love, Knud "Pinn" Johan.</strong>
